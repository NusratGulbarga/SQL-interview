### **SQL Interview Question: Meta/Facebook (Hard Level)**

A table named **"famous"** has two columns: `user_id` and `follower_id`. Each row represents a relationship where a user (identified by `user_id`) is followed by another user (identified by `follower_id`).

You need to calculate the **famous percentage** for each user.

#### **Famous Percentage Formula:**

\[
\text{Famous Percentage} = \frac{\text{Number of Followers a User Has}}{\text{Total Number of Users on the Platform}} \times 100
\]

#### **Schema and Dataset:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE famous (user_id INT, follower_id INT);

INSERT INTO famous VALUES
(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (5, 1), (5, 3), 
(11, 7), (12, 8), (13, 5), (13, 10), 
(14, 12), (14, 3), (15, 14), (15, 13);
```

#### **Expected Output:**

For each `user_id`, calculate the famous percentage based on the number of followers they have relative to the total number of users on the platform.

**Hint:**
- A user can be both a `user_id` (someone being followed) and a `follower_id` (someone following another user).
- You need to account for the total number of unique users on the platform (both `user_id` and `follower_id`).
  
### **Task:**

Write a query that calculates the famous percentage for each user.
